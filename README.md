  Floor Open Data
</h1>
A collection of datasets provided by Floor in partnership with Solana & Google. 

We are excited to be able to share this with the community & can't wait to see what you do with the data - let us know!


## Datasets

Our first open public dataset is Collection Floor Prices for collections on Solana. This collection data is what powers timeseries charts in the Floor app so is maintained with a high degree of accuracy!

## Usage
You are free to use this data as you wish for commercial, or non-commercial purposes.

## Costs
This public dataset is made available for free, but using BigQuery to query it may not be free. Google will charge you per bytes of data queried in accordance with [BigQuery Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing).

Generally speaking, querying is ~$6/TB of data queried (check the link for the latest pricing) and at time of publishing this entire dataset is 20GB (so approximately $0.12 to scan the entire dataset for all collections.)

You can dramatically reduce this cost by utilizing the [clustered fields and partitioned fields](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) for filtering. 

## Warranties and representations
This data is offered as-is with no warranties expressed or implied. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of the data and you should not rely on it for financial or reputational purposes.

This dataset may be discontinued, truncated, modified or removed at any time. By using it you agree that Floor is not liable for any costs or damages related to usage, or errors in the data, or documentation.

Usage of the data is also subject to <a href="https://www.floornfts.io/terms">Floor's terms & conditions</a>
